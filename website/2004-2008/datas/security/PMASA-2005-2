Announcement-ID: PMASA-2005-2<br />
Date: 2005-02-26
</p>
<p>
<b>Summary</b>:<br />
Path disclosure
</p>
<p>
<b>Description</b>:<br />
By calling some scripts that are part of phpMyAdmin in an unexpected way (especially scripts in the <tt>libraries</tt> subdirectory), it is possible to trigger phpMyAdmin to display a PHP error message which contains the full path of the directory where phpMyAdmin is installed.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Severity</b>:<br />
We consider those vulnerabilities to be minor (see Mitigation factor).
</p>
<p>
<b>Affected versions</b>:<br />
Probably all phpMyAdmin versions.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mitigation factor</b>:<br />
This path disclosure is possible on servers where the recommended setting of the PHP configuration directive <tt>display_errors</tt> is set to <tt>on</tt>, which is against the recommendations given in the PHP manual.
</p>
<p>
<b>Solution:</b><br />
Apply the PHP manual recommendations. Note that it's possible to apply a PHP configuration directive to a specific directory (see References).
