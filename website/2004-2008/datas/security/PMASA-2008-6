Announcement-ID: PMASA-2008-6<br />
Date: 2008-07-28<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Summary</b>:<br />
Cross-site Framing; XSS in setup.php
</p>
<p>
<b>Description</b>:<br />
We received two advisories from Aung Khant (YGN Ethical Hacker Group), and we wish to thank him for his work. It was permitted to display phpMyAdmin's frames
inside another page, opening phishing or fooling possibilities; now, a parameter AllowThirdPartyFraming must be set to true in config.inc.php to allow this behavior. Also, XSS was possible for someone who could overwrite config/config.inc.php during the time this file is present in this directory. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Severity</b>:<br />
We consider these vulnerabilities to be serious. See YGN's advisories for
some mitigation factors.
</p>
<p>
<b>Affected versions</b>:<br />
Versions before 2.11.8. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Solution:</b><br />
Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.11.8 or newer.
