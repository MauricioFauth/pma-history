Announcement-ID: PMASA-2004-3<br />
Date: 2004-11-18
</p>
<p>
<b>Summary</b>:<br />
Multiple XSS vulnerability were found in phpMyAdmin, that may allow an
attacker to conduct Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
</p>
<p>
<b>Description</b>:<br />
We received a security advisory from Cedric Cochin (netvigilance.com)
about those vulnerabilities and we wish to thank him for his work.
The vulnerabilities apply to those points:
<ol>
 <li>The logic used to auto-detect the PmaAbsoluteUri parameter can be fooled
by adding an extra &quot;/&quot; and a crafted URL.
 </li>
 <li>read_dump.php can be called with a crafted url; using the fact that
the zero_rows variable is not sanitized can lead to an attack.
 </li>
 <li>The confirm form (for example after a DROP DATABASE statement) can 
be used for a XSS attack.
 </li>
 <li>The internal phpMyAdmin parser does not sanitize the error message sent
after an error like a punctuation problem.
 </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b>Severity</b>:<br />
As any of those vulnerabilites can be used for a XSS attack, we consider them 
to be serious.
</p>
<p>
<b>Affected versions</b>:<br />
Not all previous versions are affected by all vulnerabilities, but it's safe
to say that releases up to and including 2.6.0-pl2 are at risk.
</p>
<p>
<b>Unaffected versions</b>:<br />
CVS HEAD has been fixed.
The upcoming 2.6.0-pl3 release.
</p>
<p>
<b>Solution</b>:<br />
We strongly advise everyone to upgrade to the next version of phpMyAdmin, which is to be released soon.
