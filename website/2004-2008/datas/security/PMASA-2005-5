phpMyAdmin security announcement
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Announcement-ID: PMASA-2005-5<br />
Date: 2005-10-22<br />
Updated: 2005-10-25 (reference from T.K.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Summary</b>:<br />
(1) Local file inclusion vulnerability and (2) Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability
</p>
<p>
<b>Description</b>:<br />
We received a security advisory from Stefan Esser (sesser@hardened-php.net) about (1). We received a security advisory from Tobias Klein (tk@trapkit.de) about (2). We wish to thank both of them for their work.
<br />
<br />
(1) : Due to the sequence of execution in the code that gets form parameters in some scripts, it was possible to craft a special attack form that overwrites configuration parameters.
<br />
<br />
(2) : Some scripts were vulnerable to XSS attacks: left.php, queryframe.php and server_databases.php.
</p>
<p>
<b>Severity</b>:<br />
We consider these vulnerabilities to be serious. However, (1) can be exploited only on systems not running in PHP safe mode (unless a deliberate hole was opened by including in open_basedir some paths containing sensitive data).
</p>
<p>
<b>Affected versions</b>:<br />
We did not make an extensive verification on this. Probably all previous versions.
</p>
<p>
<b>Solution:</b><br />
Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.6.4-pl3 or newer.
