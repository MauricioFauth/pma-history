<p>
<b>Summary</b>:<br />
SQL injection vulnerability (Delayed Cross Site Request Forgery)
</p>
<p>
<b>Description</b>:<br />
We received an advisory from Richard Cunningham, and we wish to thank him for his work. phpMyAdmin used the $_REQUEST superglobal as a source for its parameters, instead of $_GET and $_POST. This means that on most servers, a cookie with the same name as one of phpMyAdmin's parameters can interfere.<br /></br />
Another application could set a cookie for the root path "/" with a "sql_query" name, therefore overriding the user-submitted sql_query because by default, the $_REQUEST superglobal imports first GET, then POST then COOKIE data.
</p>
<p>
<b>Severity</b>:<br />
We consider this vulnerability to be serious.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mitigation factor</b>:<br />
An attacker must trick the victim into visiting a page on the same web server where he has placed code that creates a malicious cookie.
</p>
<p>
<b>Affected versions</b>:<br />
Versions before 2.11.5. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Solution:</b><br />
Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.11.5 or newer, where $_REQUEST is rebuilt to not contain cookies.
