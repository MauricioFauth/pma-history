<p>
<b>Summary</b>:<br />
XSS vulnerability
</p>
<p>
<b>Description</b>:<br />
We received an advisory from Omer Singer, The DigiTrust Group, and we wish to thank him for his work.<br /><br />
It was possible to trigger this attack on setup.php.
</p>
<p>
<b>Severity</b>:<br />
We consider this vulnerability to be serious; however, we could only trigger it when using Internet Explorer with the 'send URLs as UTF8' setting disabled. The default value of this setting being 'enabled' reduces the impact of this problem.
</p>
<p>
<b>Affected versions</b>:<br />
Probably all versions before 2.11.1.1. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Solution:</b><br />
Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.11.1.1 or newer.
