<b>Summary</b>:<br />
Local file inclusion vulnerability

<p>
<b>Description</b>:<br />
In <tt>libraries/grab_globals.lib.php</tt>, the <tt>$__redirect</tt> parameter was not correctly validated, opening the door to a local file inclusion attack.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Severity</b>:<br />
We consider this vulnerability to be serious. However, it can be exploited only on systems not running in PHP safe mode (unless a deliberate hole was opened by including in open_basedir some paths containing sensitive data).

phpMyAdmin versions 2.6.4 and 2.6.4-pl1.
</p>
<p>
<b>Solution:</b><br />
Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.6.4-pl2 or newer.
