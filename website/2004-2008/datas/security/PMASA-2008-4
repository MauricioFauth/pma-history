<b>Summary</b>:<br />
XSS on plausible insecure PHP installation
</p>
<p>
<b>Description</b>:<br />
We received an advisory from Tim Starling (Wikimedia), and we wish to thank him for his work. Some scripts in the /libraries directory were vulnerable to XSS. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Severity</b>:<br />
We consider this vulnerability to be serious.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mitigation factor:</b><br />
We were able to reproduce this only on systems where both of these conditions are true: the PHP register_globals setting is "on" and the web server does not apply the settings contained in the .htaccess file that we placed in /libraries.
</p>
<p>
<b>Affected versions</b>:<br />
Versions before 2.11.7. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Solution:</b><br />
Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.11.7 or newer.
</p>
